    * If scraping fails, it intelligently **analyzes keywords from the URL** itself as a fallback.
    * For product names, it uses Gemini to **generate a hypothetical, typical description** for analysis.
* **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes **Google Gemini** for a multi-faceted evaluation:
    * **Summarizes** key product characteristics.
    * **Evaluates** the likely environmental and sustainability impact.
    * **Suggests** greener, more eco-friendly alternatives when a product is not recommended.
* **Clear & Actionable Recommendations**: Provides a final verdict to guide your purchasing decisions:

## 🧬 How It Works: The Agent Workflow

The Conscious Cart agent follows a logical, multi-step process to deliver its analysis:

1.  **User Input**: The agent starts by prompting the user for a product name or URL.
2.  **Input Routing**: It determines whether the input is a URL or a product name.
3.  **Data Gathering**:
    * **If URL**: Attempts to scrape the webpage. If it fails, it extracts keywords from the URL string.
    * **If Name**: Prompts Gemini to create a detailed, hypothetical product description.
4.  **Impact Analysis**: The gathered product details are sent to Gemini with a specific prompt to analyze the environmental impact and provide a verdict.
5.  **Recommendation Generation**:
    * If the verdict is **NOT RECOMMENDED**, the agent asks Gemini to suggest specific, sustainable alternatives.
    * The final analysis and any alternatives are formatted into a clear, easy-to-read report.

## 🧪 Sample Interaction

Here’s a sample run showing the agent's capabilities when analyzing a product name.

**User Input:**
> Gold Ornaments

**Agent Output:**

> ### 📦 Product Description
>
> Gold ornaments are decorative items made from gold, used to adorn the body. They encompass a vast range of styles, designs, and purposes... Designs range from simple, minimalist pieces to elaborate, heavily embellished items featuring gemstones, intricate carvings, filigree work, and enamel...
>
> ### 🌍 Environmental Impact
>
> The environmental impact of gold ornaments is significant and multifaceted, stemming primarily from gold mining... Mining operations, particularly open-pit mining, cause widespread habitat destruction... and release large quantities of toxic chemicals, including mercury and cyanide, into water bodies...
>
> ### 📝 Final Recommendation
>
> Based on the environmental impact, I recommend a multi-pronged approach:
>
> 1.  **Prioritize recycled gold**: Actively seek out and purchase jewelry made from recycled gold to reduce the demand for newly mined gold.
> 2.  **Choose responsibly sourced gold**: Look for certifications from reputable organizations like the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC).
> 3.  **Value longevity and repair**: Treat your gold jewelry with care to extend its lifespan and repair damaged pieces instead of replacing them.
